Learning Python and DSA by building mini projects and practicing problem-solving step by step.
This repository tracks my journey of learning Python and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
Currently, it contains two mini projects:
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Blackjack Game

I will gradually add DSA topics like arrays and linked lists as I learn and practice them.
